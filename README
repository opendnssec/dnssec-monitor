INTRODUCTION
------------

This project contains tools to monitor a DNSSEC-signed zone,
including a NAGIOS plug-in.

INSTALLATION
------------

The tools can be run from the lib folder, or the contents of 
the lib folder can be copied to the location of your choice.

Works with dnsruby up to version 1.60.0, later versions of dnsruby
brake this tools. It's documented in a dnsruby github issue:
https://github.com/alexdalitz/dnsruby/issues/150

It may be necessary to :

  chmod +x dnssec_monitor.rb

RUNNING
-------

From the directory containing the code (e.g. lib), run :

  ./dnssec_monitor.rb -z <zone> [options]

where zone is the zone the be monitored. Additional options may be
viewed by running : 

  ./dnssec_monitor.rb -? 

(or -h, or --help)

Additional options include :

    -n <ns1>[,<ns2>,<ns3>,...]       Comma-separated list of nameservers
        --nameservers                to monitor for the zone. Defaults
                                     to the nameservers listed in the public DNS
        --kskwarn [n]                Warn if KSK RRSIG expiry is within n days
                                     Defaults to 14

                                     InceptionOffset, 3600 for ValidityPeriod).
                                     OpenDNSSEC must have been installed on this

                                     Defaults to print to console


NAGIOS PLUG-IN
--------------

The nagios plug-in is provided in the same lib folder. It uses the same
options as dnssec_monitor, with an additional NAGIOS-specific option :

   -v, --verbose [n]                 Set the NAGIOS verbosity to n


FUNCTIONALITY 
-------------

Zone Apex Checks
   The following records are checked at the zone apex : DNSKEY, SOA and NS.
   For each of these RRSets, the RRSIGs are verified using one of the DNSKEYs at the apex.
   For these RRSIGs, the signature expiration is checked to ensure it is a certain amount from the current time.
   For these RRSIGs, the signature inception is checked to ensure it is a certain amount before the current time.
   For these RRSIGs, the signature lifetime (expiration - inception) is checked for a minimum level.
   Check that at least one DNSKEY matches DS in parent zone (or in the ISC DLV registry)

The inception/expiration tolerances may be obtained from the OpenDNSSEC configuration files, if available. Otherwise, command line options or defaults are used.

A list of names (or a zone file) may be specified, for which the RRSIGs should be checked as per the zone apex RRSIG checks. If found, DS records for the specified children are checked against the published children zones.

It is also possible to validate the zone from the signed root or ISC DLV registry.

TESTING
-------

The test code can be run from the main project folder :

sudo ruby -I lib test/tc_monitor.rb

Root privileges are required to start a test server on port 53.
Additionally, a tld is checked using the ISC DLV registry. This
can take some seconds to complete.
